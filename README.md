  The goal of this repository is to explore about explainable learning in computer vision. More precisely, activation maps and 
kernel visualization.

  <h2 id="usage" > ðŸ‘· Usage </h2>

  - To run the program locally, you will need to:
    - create & activate python virtual environment;
    - install dependencies in environment;
    - run the `src/train.py` to train the desired model on the dataset;
    - execute `src/GradModule/activation.py` with the arguments;

  ```bash
  # Commands used to start the project.
  ```
